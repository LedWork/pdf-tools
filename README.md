# pdf-tools

Small project that can do for free which you are only able to do with paid tools


## Installation

First, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required Python package by running:

source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

## PDF Merger

This script merges two PDF files into one single PDF file.

To merge two PDF files, run the script from the command line by providing the paths to the two input PDF files and the desired output PDF file name:

```bash
python pdf-tools.py merge input1.pdf input2.pdf output.pdf
```

Replace input1.pdf and input2.pdf with the filenames of your PDF files you want to merge, and output.pdf with the filename you want the merged PDF to have.
